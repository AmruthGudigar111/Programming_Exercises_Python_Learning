🐍 **Python Programming Lab – 10 Practice Programs**

This repository includes 10 beginner-friendly Python programs designed to cover core programming concepts such as basic input/output, conditionals, loops, data structures, file handling, exception handling, and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming).

## 📋 Program List

1. **Basic I/O and Arithmetic**
   - Take two numbers as input and display their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

2. **Conditional Statements**
   - Find the largest among three numbers using `if-elif-else`.

3. **Loops – Fibonacci Series**
   - Print the Fibonacci series up to `n` terms.

4. **List Operations**
   - Input a list of numbers and display the sum and average.

5. **String Manipulation**
   - Reverse a string and check if it's a palindrome.

6. **Dictionary Use**
   - Create a dictionary with student names and marks. Print names with marks greater than 75.

7. **Function Use**
   - Define a function that returns the factorial of a number.

8. **File Handling**
   - Read contents from a file and count the number of words.

9. **Exception Handling**
   - Handle divide-by-zero errors using `try-except`.

10. **Object-Oriented Programming**
   - Create a `Student` class and display student details.
